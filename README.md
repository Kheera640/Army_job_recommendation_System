# 🪖 Army Job Recommendation System

The **Army Job Recommendation System** is a project designed to help ex-army personnel transition into civilian employment by matching their profiles with relevant job opportunities. It leverages a curated job database and customizable matching logic to suggest roles that align with their experience, skills, and preferences.

## 🧠 How It Works

The system uses a structured job dataset that includes fields like:
- `Experience`, `Qualifications`, `Job Title`, `Role`
- `Location`, `Salary Range`, `Skills`, `Responsibilities`
- `Company Profile`, `Benefits`, `Job Description`, and more

Matching logic can be built on top of this using:
- Keyword extraction from job descriptions
- Experience and skill-level mapping
- Preference-based scoring
- Machine learning models (optional for future enhancement)
